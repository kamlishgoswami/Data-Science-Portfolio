# Project 1: Washignton House Prices Prediction

•	Downloaded real estate property dataset from Kaggle for Washington, USA.

•	Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

•	Conducted feature engineering to create new meaningful features.

•	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and understand the data distribution and relationships.

•	Split the data into training and testing sets using a 75% training and 25% testing split.

•	Optimized Linear Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and Support Vector Regressor using GridSearchCV to reach the best model

•	Developed a client-facing API using FastAPI to provide real estate price predictions based on the deployed model.

•	Created a website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to enhance user experience and interact with the API.

•	Deployed the model, API, and website to AWS for accessibility and scalability.

Technologies Used: Python, Numpy, Pandas Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, FastAPI, AWS, HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and JavaScript.
